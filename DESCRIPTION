Description: Tools to download and manipulate the Permanent Household Survey from Argentina
    (EPH is the Spanish acronym for Permanent Household Survey).
    e.g: get_microdata() for downloading the datasets, get_poverty_lines() for downloading the official poverty baskets,
    calculate_poverty() for the calculation of stating if a household is in poverty or not, following the official methodology.
    organize_panels() is used to concatenate observations from different periods, and organize_labels()
    adds the official labels to the data. The implemented methods are based on INDEC (2016) <ISSN 2545-7179>.
